# AndroidMe

This is an example Android app that demonstrates understanding of Fragments and responsive design for multiple form factors, created as part of the [Android Developer Nanodegree by Google](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801). A user selects body parts of an Android avatar to create a unique compilation image. Both phone (single-pane) and tablet (two-pane) UI's are implemented.
